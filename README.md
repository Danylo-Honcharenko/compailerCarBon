# Compailer Carbon 1.0 for learning
Use cmake to build. The program is written using Visual Studio, 
so the format library is not in the project directory.

## How to build a project?
We clone the repository, 
then we go into the 
project and do `cmake .` then `cmake --build .`.

## Project structure
`dist` - folder with compiled files (res, set, out are 
created when the "carbon compiler" 
compiler is running but are not compiled)

`doc` - documentation folder for compiler functions

`lib` - additional libraries

`src` - cpp project files
